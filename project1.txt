Project1

Goal :
Ingest tables from MySql retail_db into Hive
customers
categories
products
departments
order_detail (partitioned table created by joining orders and order_detail)

Step1.
=============================
Use the retail_db database in MySql
Create a daily partitioned table order_detail by joining orders and order_items.
The order_detail table will have and additional column trans_date of type date
Load approx 20% of records from order_items (joined with orders table) into each of the 5 partitions of the order_detail Table.

Step2.
=====================================
Create folder structure in local linux
/home/cloudera/training/project1
                                 /workflows/wf_db_ingest
                                 /hive
                                 /scripts
                                 /logs
                                 
Create folder structure in HDFS
/user/cloudera/training/project1
                                 /workflows/wf_db_ingest
                        
Step3.
=====================================
Create hive db retail_stg with following tables 
                                 
  Step5.
  ============================================
  Create one parameterized oozie workflow with 3 actions
  sqoop - to sqoop from  MySql into retail_stg db  as delimited text with control A as delimiter
  hive  - to load the sqooped data into a parquet table in retail database
  python script to validate the counts between MySql and Impala
